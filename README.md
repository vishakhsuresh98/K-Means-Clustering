# K-Means-Clustering
An implementation of K Means clustering in Python

Dataset : 100 points have been considered in the two-dimensional XY space. For visualizing the
clustering process clearly, these points have been generated by spreading points randomly
around 3 specific points (pivots) in the 2D space .i.e. more specifically (30, 70), (75, 65) and
(50, 40).
